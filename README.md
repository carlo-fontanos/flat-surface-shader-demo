The Flat Surface Shader is a simple plugin developed by Matthew Wagerfield which is based on the Lambertian Reflectance model, where the color of a triangle is calculated by a variety of different light sources within a particular scene. It is a great alternative to creating 3d effects with WebGL. Basically, this cool toy takes geometry, light and triangles and turns it into something fun, exciting and beautiful that everyone can use. With this Flat Surface Shader, triangles are rendered into three different contexts (WebGL, Canvas 2D and SVG). You can customize the settings yourself and even export your finished piece of art as a SVG or a PNG graphic that you can use later. What makes this project even better is that it is open source. You can visit their website, have a look at the code yourself and you can even adapt it or make it better if you want to.
